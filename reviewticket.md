## Build a Data Model(s) using UML
Isabel used draw.io to easily build a basic data model while dicussing with  team mates (crow's feet diagram:) and primary keys (that are unique) and foreign keys!

### JWT

To set up the login and password, we will use Mortensen's code 2.4a SQL/2.4b SQL B as a guide.

### Start shared Frontend Repo using  Jekyll Minma
Justin made a team repository from the student repo.  He got rid of Time Box or Blog page for customization. He started to try and recreate our  User Interface (UI) according to Frontend Design. Frontend developers will design frontend and screen transitions before data is available, this meet requirements of this step in process.  Justin will work on the stress quiz, the backend for it (seperate blue print).


### Flask Repo
Anusha  made  Backend Repo using Flask/Flask. We made a team repository from flask portfolio and review flask anatomy and start to customize for your needs, such as app roots.  According to UML design, I thought about defining APIs with static data to support development. Early testing is done with a tool called Postman, this would meet requirements of this step in process.  She will work on the motivational games, food/water tracker, spinners, and badges.
