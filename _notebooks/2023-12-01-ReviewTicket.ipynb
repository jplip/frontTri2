    "Binary achievement badges serve as a creative and unique way to represent milestones or accomplishments within an application.  Utilizing binary in badges offers an opportunity for educational engagement.  Each bit has its own color  is the smallest unit of data in a computer. A bit has a single binary value, either 0 or 1. The exercise data of the user is converted into binary and used into badges. Clients may become curious about binary representations and may seek to understand how binary numbers work, leading to informal learning. Implementing unique binary-based badges can set an application apart from others, establishing a distinct identity and branding. It can become a distinguishing feature that users associate with the application. This also uses AND OR Logic Gates.\n",

    "(Note: Backend is still un functional due to community server problems.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "Justin and Isabel first decided on the HTML/CSS structure\n",
    "HTML Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "The HTML structure includes checkboxes for \"Completed Exercise,\" \"Rest Day,\" and \"Favorite Exercise.\" These checkboxes have unique IDs and an onchange attribute, which calls the updateAchievementBadge() function whenever the checkboxes are changed.\n",
    "There's a <div> element with an ID of \"achievementContainer\" where the generated binary pattern will be displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Justin and Isabel then  decided on the Javascript Structure. \n",
    "JavaScript: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "updateAchievementBadge() function: This function is triggered whenever any checkbox changes its state (checked or unchecked). It retrieves the checked state of each checkbox and calculates two boolean variables - allAchievementsUnlocked and anyAchievementUnlocked based on the combinations of checkboxes checked.\n",
    "generateBinaryPattern() function: It takes in the boolean variables as parameters and generates a binary pattern based on these conditions:\n",
    "If all checkboxes are checked (allAchievementsUnlocked is true), the binary pattern is '111'.\n",
    "If any checkbox is checked (anyAchievementUnlocked is true), the binary pattern is '100'.\n",
    "If no checkbox is checked, the binary pattern is '000'.\n",
    "displayAchievementBadge() function: This function takes the generated binary pattern as an argument and displays it inside the achievementContainer div.\n",
    "However, there's a comment indicating that there should be code added to actually display the achievement badge based on the binary pattern. As it stands, this code only generates the binary pattern based on checkbox states and displays it on the webpage, but there's no functionality to visually represent the achievements or badges.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this code fully functional, additional code would need to be added within the displayAchievementBadge() function to generate visual badges or representations based on the binary pattern generated. This might involve using CSS to style the badges or images and dynamically showing/hiding them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Binary Form, ...EXPLORATION/IDEATION\n",
    "This code is meant to be a simple exercise of binary choices. Although the code doesn't directly deal with binary numbers or operations, it helps in understanding how binary choices (true/false, on/off) are applied in programming as binary flags to control various features or states within an application. Understanding binary principles aids in comprehending the foundational concepts used in programming, regardless of the programming language or domain.\n",
    "![life.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iKAN2025/Nighthawk-Pages/main/images/binarylogic.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedure\n",
    "We decided to implement a validation/error checking algorithm into our code such that we ensure the logical consistency of checkbox combinations (such as disallowing the selection of both \"Rest Day\" and \"Completed Exercise\" on the same day), we modified the event listeners for the checkboxes in the provided HTML/JavaScript code.\n",
    "For HTML, we decided it contain checkboxes for various exercise-related features, such as \"Completed Exercise,\" \"Rest Day,\" \"Favorite Exercise,\" \"Warm-up Completed,\" and \"Cool-down Completed.\" JavaScript Logic: Checkbox Selection: JavaScript selects each checkbox element using document.getElementById() and assigns them to corresponding variables completedExerciseCheckbox, restDayCheckbox, etc.Event Listeners: Event listeners (addEventListener) are added to the \"Completed Exercise\" and \"Rest Day\" checkboxes. When the state of the \"Completed Exercise\" checkbox changes (change event), the associated function checks if both \"Rest Day\" and \"Completed Exercise\" checkboxes are checked simultaneously.\n",
    "If both are checked, the logic immediately unchecks the \"Completed Exercise\" checkbox and triggers an alert message notifying the user about the logical inconsistency. Similar event listeners and logic can be applied to other checkbox combinations to enforce additional rules or validations based on exercise tracking requirements. However, for brevity, these additional checks are not explicitly shown in the provided example.\n",
    "Explanation of the Validation Logic: Both event listeners (change events) for \"Completed Exercise\" and \"Rest Day\" checkboxes have identical logic.\n",
    "Upon detecting a change in the checkbox state, the event listener checks if both checkboxes are checked at the same time.\n",
    "If both checkboxes are checked simultaneously, indicating an illogical scenario where a user marks both a \"Rest Day\" and a \"Completed Exercise\" on the same day, the code intervenes. It immediately unchecks the \"Completed Exercise\" checkbox to rectify the inconsistency and prevent this illogical combination. Additionally, an alert message is triggered to notify the user about the prevented action and to clarify the logical rule: \"You cannot mark both 'Rest Day' and 'Completed Exercise' on the same day.\" This validation logic ensures that users cannot inadvertently select contradictory checkbox combinations, maintaining logical consistency within the Exercise Tracker interface and guiding users to make valid selections based on the exercise tracking guidelines.\n",

    "\n",
    "Anusha and Vibha the code serves as an educational tool, showcasing the integration of HTML, JavaScript, and basic mathematical operations to create a functional and interactive web-based application for tracking and converting numeric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Procedure   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Structure:\n",
    "Anusha and Vibha decided for: \n",
    "    - Two sets of labels, input fields, and buttons for entering water consumed and food consumed.\n",
    "  - Display sections for total water and food consumed:\n",
    "    - Each section includes an `<h2>` heading and displays the total consumed in both decimal and binary formats.\n",
    "  - Section for converting binary to decimal:\n",
    "    - Input field to enter a binary number, a convert button, and a paragraph element to display the converted decimal result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Functionality (JavaScript):\n",
    "- **Variables:**\n",
    "  - `waterTotal` and `foodTotal` hold the cumulative values of water and food consumed.\n",
    "- **Functions:**\n",
    "  - `updateWaterTotal()` and `updateFoodTotal()`: Update the displayed total values and their binary representations for water and food.\n",
    "  - `convertToBinary(num)`: Converts a decimal number to its binary representation.\n",
    "  - `addWater()` and `addFood()`: Calculate and update the total consumed amounts when the respective \"Add\" buttons are clicked.\n",
    "  - `convertToDecimal()`: Convert the entered binary number to its decimal equivalent and display the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "- Clients input the amount of water or food consumed in the respective input fields and click \"Add Water\" or \"Add Food.\"\n",
    "- The totals for water and food consumed (both in decimal and binary) are updated accordingly.\n",
    "- The \"Convert Binary to Decimal\" section allows users to input a binary number, click \"Convert,\" and see the decimal equivalent.\n",

    "### HTML Form:\n",
    "- The HTML includes a form (`<form id=\"exerciseForm\">`) with input fields for a user's name, exercise type, duration, and exercise date. It also includes a submit button to submit the form.\n",
    "-Nested JSON to store User Data!\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Listener for Form Submission:**\n",
    "   - An event listener is attached to the form (`document.getElementById('exerciseForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) { ... });`), preventing the default form submission behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fetching User Data:**\n",
    "   - The script starts by retrieving the logged-in user's ID from the local storage (`const userIDFromLocalStorage = localStorage.getItem('loggedInUserId');`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Form Data Handling and API Request:**\n",
    "   - When the form is submitted, the entered data (name, exercise type, duration, and exercise date) is collected.\n",
    "   - A `fetch` request is made to the server to retrieve user data based on the user ID.\n",
    "   - The retrieved data is combined with the new exercise data, and the updated user data (including exercise information) is sent back to the server through a `PUT` request using `fetch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Binary Duration Display:**\n",
    "   - The entered duration is converted from decimal to binary using the `decimalToBinary()` function (`function decimalToBinary(number) { ... }`).\n",
    "   - The binary representation of the duration is displayed visually as a badge using the `displayBinaryBadge()` function (`function displayBinaryBadge(binaryString) { ... }`).\n",
    "   - The badge is displayed based on the binary string's value, with '1's and '0's represented by HTML spans with specific styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Binary Badge Creation:**\n",
    "   - The `createBadge()` function generates the visual representation of the binary number as a badge with '1's and '0's.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **IFrame:**\n",
    "   - Finally, an `<iframe>` element is included in the HTML, embedding an external URL (`https://jplip.github.io/frontTri2/exercisegraph/`) to display graphs based on user data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convert Decimal to Binary:**\n",
    "  - The `decimalToBinary()` function converts a decimal number to its binary representation using JavaScript's bitwise right shift (`>>>`) operation and `toString()` method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Display Binary Badge:**\n",
    "  - The `displayBinaryBadge()` function takes the binary string representation of the duration and visually represents it as a badge, showing a series of '1's and '0's based on the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code primarily focuses on handling form submissions, making API requests, converting numbers from decimal to binary, and visually representing the binary duration using HTML elements and styles.\n",
