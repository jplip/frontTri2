    "# What is an Undecidable Problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some problems take a very long time to solve, so we use algorithms that give approximate solutions. There are some problems that a computer can never solve, even the world's most powerful computer with infinite time: the undecidable problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- An decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct number for all inputs (eg: is the number even) (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.1)\n",
    "- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorith can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.2) An undecidable problem may have some instances  that have an algorthimic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem. \n",

    "# Halting Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The Halting Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem in computer science, formulated by Alan Turing in the 1930s. It addresses the fundamental question of whether a program, given any input, will eventually halt (terminate) or run indefinitely (enter an infinite loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the Halting Problem revolves around creating an algorithm that can accurately determine, for any program and input, whether that program will halt or continue running forever. Alan Turing proved that such an algorithm cannot exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this program that counts down:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplip/frontTri2/main/images/decided.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That program will halt, since num eventually becomes 0.\n",
    "Compare that to this program that counts up:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplip/frontTri2/main/images/undecided.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It counts up forever, since num will never equal 0.\n",
    "Algorithms do exist that can correctly predict that the first program halts and the second program never does. These are simple programs which don't change based on different inputs.\n",
    "However, no algorithm exists that can analyze any program's code and determine whether it halts or not.\n",

    "# Turing's Proof Through Contradiction: \n",
    "defintion proof through contradiction: a form of proof that assumes a claim false and shows that this state leads to a known contradiction; therefore, the claim must be true\n",
    "1. **We assume the halting algoritm exists**\n",
    "So here's the basic code flowchart for the halting algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the reverser (which consists of its halting algorithm) which basically does the opposite of the halting algoritm returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reverser works on programs such as Count Up or Count Down until 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **The contradiction**\n",
    "But if we plug Reverser into itself....\n",
    "\n",
    "**Reverser does the opposite of HaltChecker so HaltChecker can never be right.**\n",

    "- Green Path: If HaltCheck says Reverser halts; the Reverser will never halt\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we said that HaltChecker exists and is always correct.\n",
    "3. **Conclusion**\n",
    "Therefore, HaltChecker cannot exist.\n"
