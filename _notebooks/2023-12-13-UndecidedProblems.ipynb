    "\n",
    "Some problems take a very long time to solve, so we use algorithms that give approximate solutions. There are some problems that a computer can never solve, even the world's most powerful computer with infinite time: the undecidable problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- An decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct number for all inputs (eg: is the number even) (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.1)\n",
    "- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorith can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.2) An undecidable problem may have some instances  that have an algorthimic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem."

    " A company is developing a tool to detect \"unreachable code\": code in a program that will never be executed because no paths ever lead to that line of code. They want to release the tool with the promise that it will \"find and delete 100% of the unreachable code in your codebase!\" Unfortunately, one of the programmers does some research and realizes that determining whether a line of code is unreachable is an undecidable problem.\n",

    "# Halting Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The Halting Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem in computer science, formulated by Alan Turing in the 1930s. It addresses the fundamental question of whether a program, given any input, will eventually halt (terminate) or run indefinitely (enter an infinite loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the Halting Problem revolves around creating an algorithm that can accurately determine, for any program and input, whether that program will halt or continue running forever. Alan Turing proved that such an algorithm cannot exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this program that counts down:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Decided](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplip/frontTri2/main/images/decided.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That program will halt, since num eventually becomes 0.\n",
    "Compare that to this program that counts up:\n",

    "![Undecided](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplip/frontTri2/main/images/undecided.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It counts up forever, since num will never equal 0.\n",
    "Algorithms do exist that can correctly predict that the first program halts and the second program never does. These are simple programs which don't change based on different inputs.\n",
    "However, no algorithm exists that can analyze any program's code and determine whether it halts or not."
