    "# What is an Undecidable Problem? \n",
    "\n",
    "Some problems take a very long time to solve, so we use algorithms that give approximate solutions. There are some problems that a computer can never solve, even the world's most powerful computer with infinite time: the undecidable problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- An decidable problem is a decision problem for which an algorithm can be written to produce a correct number for all inputs (eg: is the number even) (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.1)\n",
    "- An undecidable problem is one for which no algorith can be constructed that is always capable of providing a correct yes-or-no answer. (Collegeboard AAP-4.B.2) An undecidable problem may have some instances  that have an algorthimic solution, but there is no algorithmic solution that could solve all instances of the problem. \n",

    "# Halting Problem \n",
    "\n",
    "The Halting Problem is a classic example of an undecidable problem in computer science, formulated by Alan Turing in the 1930s. It addresses the fundamental question of whether a program, given any input, will eventually halt (terminate) or run indefinitely (enter an infinite loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "The essence of the Halting Problem revolves around creating an algorithm that can accurately determine, for any program and input, whether that program will halt or continue running forever. Alan Turing proved that such an algorithm cannot exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, consider this program that counts down:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplip/frontTri2/main/images/decided.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "That program will halt, since num eventually becomes 0.\n",
    "Compare that to this program that counts up:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jplip/frontTri2/main/images/undecided.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It counts up forever, since num will never equal 0.\n",
    "Algorithms do exist that can correctly predict that the first program halts and the second program never does. These are simple programs which don't change based on different inputs.\n",
    "However, no algorithm exists that can analyze any program's code and determine whether it halts or not.\n",

    "1. **We assume the halting algoritm exists**\n",
    "So here's the basic code flowchart for the halting algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the reverser (which consists of its halting algorithm) which basically does the opposite of the halting algoritm returns.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Reverser works on programs such as Count Up or Count Down until 0.\n",

    "2. **The contradiction**\n",

    "- Green Path: If HaltCheck says Reverser halts; the Reverser will never halt\n",

    "However, we said that HaltChecker exists and is always correct.\n",

    "## Exercise Tracker-Isabel\n",
    "### HTML Form:\n",
    "- The HTML includes a form (`<form id=\"exerciseForm\">`) with input fields for a user's name, exercise type, duration, and exercise date. It also includes a submit button to submit the form.\n",
    "-Nested JSON to store User Data!\n",
    "\n",
    "### JavaScript Code:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Event Listener for Form Submission:**\n",
    "   - An event listener is attached to the form (`document.getElementById('exerciseForm').addEventListener('submit', function(event) { ... });`), preventing the default form submission behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Fetching User Data:**\n",
    "   - The script starts by retrieving the logged-in user's ID from the local storage (`const userIDFromLocalStorage = localStorage.getItem('loggedInUserId');`).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Form Data Handling and API Request:**\n",
    "   - When the form is submitted, the entered data (name, exercise type, duration, and exercise date) is collected.\n",
    "   - A `fetch` request is made to the server to retrieve user data based on the user ID.\n",
    "   - The retrieved data is combined with the new exercise data, and the updated user data (including exercise information) is sent back to the server through a `PUT` request using `fetch`.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Binary Duration Display:**\n",
    "   - The entered duration is converted from decimal to binary using the `decimalToBinary()` function (`function decimalToBinary(number) { ... }`).\n",
    "   - The binary representation of the duration is displayed visually as a badge using the `displayBinaryBadge()` function (`function displayBinaryBadge(binaryString) { ... }`).\n",
    "   - The badge is displayed based on the binary string's value, with '1's and '0's represented by HTML spans with specific styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Binary Badge Creation:**\n",
    "   - The `createBadge()` function generates the visual representation of the binary number as a badge with '1's and '0's.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **IFrame:**\n",
    "   - Finally, an `<iframe>` element is included in the HTML, embedding an external URL (`https://jplip.github.io/frontTri2/exercisegraph/`) to display graphs based on user data\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithms:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Convert Decimal to Binary:**\n",
    "  - The `decimalToBinary()` function converts a decimal number to its binary representation using JavaScript's bitwise right shift (`>>>`) operation and `toString()` method.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Display Binary Badge:**\n",
    "  - The `displayBinaryBadge()` function takes the binary string representation of the duration and visually represents it as a badge, showing a series of '1's and '0's based on the value.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code primarily focuses on handling form submissions, making API requests, converting numbers from decimal to binary, and visually representing the binary duration using HTML elements and styles.\n",

    "  - Creates a new `User` object based on the provided data. If exercise or tracking data is present, it creates the user accordingly.\n",

    "  - Reads JSON data from the request body.\n",
    "  - Retrieves UID and password from the data.\n",
    "  - Searches for a user with the given UID in the database.\n",
    "  - If the user exists and the provided password matches the user's password, it logs the user in using `login_user(user)`. Then, it returns the user's data in JSON format.\n",

    "While these procedures involve data manipulation, extraction, and decision-making, they may not fit the traditional definition of an algorithm in a strict computational or mathematical sense. Instead, they represent procedural steps or logical sequences applied to process data and handle API requests/responses within a web application context.\n",
