### 1. Review of the Definition of an Undecided Problem

 A company is developing a tool to detect "unreachable code": code in a program that will never be executed because no paths ever lead to that line of code. They want to release the tool with the promise that it will "find and delete 100% of the unreachable code in your codebase!" Unfortunately, one of the programmers does some research and realizes that determining whether a line of code is unreachable is an undecidable problem.

**What are the consequences of the problem being undecidable?**

**A.** The programmers can come up with an algorithm that will find 100% of the unreachable code, but it would take an unreasonable amount of time to run.

**B.** The programmers can come up with an algorithm that correctly determines unreachable code most of the time, but it will not correctly identify unreachable code in all cases.

**C.** The programmers may be able to come up with an algorithm to find 100% of the unreachable code, but nobody has come up with the algorithm yet, so they will need more development time.

**D.** The tool will not be able to correctly identify any cases of unreachable code.

  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <strong>B</strong> is the correct answer as the definition of an undecided problem states that an algorithm may be able to solve the problem in some cases but no algorithm exists to solve all cases.

### 2. Review of the Halting Problem

Which of the following options best summarizes the Halting Problem?

**A.** The Halting Problem is a decision problem in computability theory that seeks to determine whether a given algorithm will halt or run indefinitely for all possible inputs.

**B.** The Halting Problem is a sorting algorithm designed to arrange elements in ascending order.

**C.** The Halting Problem is a protocol used to secure communications over the internet.

**D.** The Halting Problem is a theorem in number theory that deals with prime numbers.

  <summary>Solution</summary>
  <strong>A</strong> is the correct answer as the Halting Problem was Turing's proof of the existence of an undecided problem.
