## Story Map

## Why would Collegeboard like this project?

**Wellness Promotion:**
Encouraging physical activity aligns with the promotion of overall student well-being. A fitness tracker project could contribute to fostering a healthier lifestyle among students, which can positively impact their academic performance and general health.

**Data-Driven Insights:**
Fitness trackers generate data on students' physical activity levels, sleep patterns, and other health metrics. This data can be valuable for educational institutions to gain insights into students' well-being, potentially identifying trends or patterns that could inform campus wellness programs.
